// executing environment. Unlike Log it can accept any data and resulting

// from outside and act upon accordingly. This function uses

// verification or application. It can be used to differentiate running contract
// as a part of verification process from running it as a regular application.

// not available when running with verification trigger. This function uses

// Serialize serializes any given item into a byte slice. It works for all
// regular VM types (not ones from interop package) and allows to save them in
