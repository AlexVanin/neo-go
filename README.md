# Overview
### Long term project goals
Full port of the original C# [NEO project](https://github.com/neo-project). A complete toolkit for the NEO blockchain.

- Full server (consensus and RPC) nodes.
- RPC client
- build, compile and deploy smart contracts with the Go vm

### Current state
This project is still under heavy development. Still working on internal API's and project layout. This should not take longer than 2 weeks. 

# Getting started 
If you can't wait to experiment with the current state of the project. clone the project, cd into it and run:

`go install ./cmd/neoserver`

Make sure you have a private net running. If you dont, take a look at [docker-privnet-with-gas](https://hub.docker.com/r/metachris/neo-privnet-with-gas/).

`neoserver -seed 127.0.0.1:20333`

The only thing the server currently will do is asking for peers and connect to the responded peers. All other messages are in development.
